# Garage-Door-Opener-System-Model-with-Simulink
## 1. Project Description
This project aims to develop a dynamic model of a garage door opener system using Simulink. Garage door systems are critical components in modern homes, providing convenience and security. This project encompasses the modeling of the mechanical system, the design of the control algorithm, and the analysis of simulation results. The goal is to provide a platform that simulates the behavior of a garage door in real-world conditions, which can be utilized in the design of control systems. By simulating various scenarios, users can better understand the dynamics involved and improve the safety and efficiency of garage door operations.

## 2. Features

* **Mechanical System Modeling:** The garage door is modeled as a mass moving along rails, allowing for realistic simulations of its dynamics.
* **Control Mechanism:** The door's movement is controlled by a button input, limit switches, and a photo sensor, ensuring responsive and safe operation.
* **Safety Features:** Integrated limit switches and a photo sensor ensure the safe operation of the door, preventing accidents and damage.
* **Real-Time Simulation:** Interactive tests can be performed using Simulink's real-time simulation capability, enabling users to observe immediate effects of control inputs.
* **Visualization:** Scopes are used to visualize the door's position and motor commands, providing clear insights into system performance.
* **Scenario Testing:** Users can simulate various scenarios, such as power failure or obstruction, to evaluate system robustness.
